Hyperdraft is an app for writing. Inspired by [Notational Velocity](KVC_VITRINE_NV_URL), it is keyboard-focused and allows you to link between notes. Additionally, it can generate a website from your public notes.

The code is open-source and available on [GitHub](KVC_SHARED_GITHUB_URL).

The project is freely accessible but if you are in a position to give, please [donate](KVC_SHARED_DONATE_URL) to support future development.
